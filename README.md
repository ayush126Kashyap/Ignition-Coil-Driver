# Ignition-Coil-Driver
This project is a high-voltage ignition coil driver circuit using an IRF540N MOSFET and a 1N4007 flyback diode. It efficiently drives an ignition coil to generate high-voltage pulses. The circuit is designed for experimental and educational purposes, demonstrating MOSFET switching and flyback energy management.
